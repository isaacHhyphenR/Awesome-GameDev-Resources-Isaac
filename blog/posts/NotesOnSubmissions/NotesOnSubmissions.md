Here goes my personal opinions, rules and processes that I follow about submissions. I will cover gradings, deadlines, tolerances, and AI-assistant tools usage.

## Policy on Limited use of AI-assisted tools 

!!! note

    "During our classes, we may use AI writing tools such as ChatGPT in certain specific cases. You will be informed as to when, where, and how these tools are permitted to be used, along with guidance for attribution. Any use outside of these specific cases  constitutes a violation of Academic Honesty Policy." [Source](https://clt.champlain.edu/kb/communicating-your-chatgpt-ai-policies/).

The learner has to produce original content. You can use tools like ChatGPT to help yu learn by propting your own questions, but not to solve the problems, assignments or quizzes.

The rationale is that the student has to learn the concepts and ideas, and not just copy and paste the answers.

### What is acceptable:

- On writting, coding assignments or interactive assignments, you can ask AI questions about concepts, ideas, sintaxes etc;
- You can ask AI assistants what is wrong with your code, but you cannot use the answer 1 to 1 copy to your final submission, you have to modify it;
- If your submission contains part of AI assisted tool, you have to cite it. Ex.: "I prompted ____ in ChatGPT and the answer was ____.", and as a professor, I will deduct points from your submission with fairness instead of giving you zero points;

### What is not acceptable

- You cannot copy the question and prompt AI to answer it and then use the answer as your own;
- You cannot ask AI to code a solution for you;
- You cannot use any kind of AI while coding(Ex.: GH Copilot), but I do recommend you to use any IDE instead;
- You are not allowed to use AI assistace to solve quizzes or exams in any circunstances.
- Even on accepted cases, using AI assistance and not citing it will be considered plagiarism and will be reported to higher instances and zero-ed;

### How do I detect Plagiarism and AI-assisted tools abuse

- I use some automated tools such as turnitin(canvas), moss(beecrowd), and others;
- I use my own experience to detect plagiarism;
- If two students uses the same AI assistant, chances are high that they will produce the same answer, and I will detect it;

## Grading Timings

I usually take up to 1 week to grade assignments, but I will try to grade them as soon as possible. The worst case scenario is 2 weeks.

## Late Submissions Policy

If you submit an assignment late, you will receive a flat 20% deduction on your grade.

If you have accomodations, send me a message through me and I will try to accomodate you. But always send a message on every submission stating that. Canvas is a nice tool, but it does not cover accomodations well.

If you fall under especial conditions, such as sickness, death of a relative, or any other condition that you cannot submit the assignment on time, please send me a message through canvas me and I will try to accomodate you.

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is a serious offense and will be reported to the higher instances. I will not tolerate any kind of plagiarism.

I define plagiarism the act of:

- Searching for answers on the internet and copy and paste it as your own;
- Copying answers from other students;
- Using AI-assisted tools to produce full answers;
- Using AI-assisted tools to produce partial answers without citing it;

## Welcoming environment

I am here to teach you the best as I can and guide you through your learning process. You can count on me as a friend and a teacher. I will try to help you as much as I can. I am willing to make exceptions for the ones that need it.
