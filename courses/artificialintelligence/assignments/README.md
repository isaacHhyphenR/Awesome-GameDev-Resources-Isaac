# Setup the repos

We are going to use the following repositories:

1. Read about Privacy and FERPA compliance [here](../../../blog/posts/FerpaCompliance/FerpaCompliance.md)
2. This one, for in class coding assignments. https://github.com/InfiniBrains/Awesome-GameDev-Resources
3. MoBaGEn, for interactive assignments. https://github.com/InfiniBrains/mobagen

## Types of coding assignments

There are two types of coding assignments:

1. Algorithm: [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/) - This is an automatic grading system, and I am still creating assignments for it. I will try my best to make it work through it. If it does not work, you could just submit the code on canvas and I will grade it manually;
2. Interactive: For the interactive assignments you can choose whatever Game Engine you like, but I recommend you to use the framework I created for you: [MoBaGEn](https://github.com/InfiniBrains/mobagen).

!!! danger

    Under no circunstaces, you should make your algorithm solutions public. Be aware that I spend so much time creating them and it is hard to me to always create new assignments.

## Code assignments

!!! inline end warning

    If you are a enrolled in a class that uses this material, you SHOULD use the institutional and internal git server to be [FERPA](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) compliant. If you want to use part of this assignments to build your portfolio I recommend you to use github and make the interactive assignment public. If you are just worried about privacy concerns, you can use a private repo on github.

1. Create an account on github.com or any `git` hosting on your preference;
2. Fork repos or duplicate the target repo on your account; 
   
    1. If you want to make it count as part of your portfolio, fork the repo follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo);
    2. If you want to keep it private or be FERPA compliant, duplicate the repo following [this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository);
   
3. Add my user to your repo to it with `read` role. My userid is `tolstenko` on github, for other options, talk with me in class. Follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository);
4. Send me a message on canvas with the link to your repo;

## Development tools

I will be using CMake for the classes, but you can use whatever you want. Please [read this](../../intro/02-tooling/README.md) to understand the C++ toolset.

## Recordings

In all interactive assignmets, you will have to record a 5 minute video explaing your code. Use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or any software you prefer to record your screen while you explain your code. But for this one, just send me the video showing the repo and the repo invites sent to me.

## Grading

20 points total:

- 5 Points – inviting me to the repos;
- 5 Points – sending me the video explaining the repo and the invite sent to me;
- 10 Points - Show the repos cloned on your computer;
